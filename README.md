# Features
* Unique Plant Traits
* Random Terrain
* Plant Growth
* Branching, Leaves

# In Development 
* View Plants By Performance
* Reproduction
* Photosynthesis and Energy Production
* Roots and More Complex Plants
* Simulate by Generation or Continuous
* Configurable Environment Conditions

# Organization
Heavy object oriented programming is utlizied to allow for many genes and unique plant parts. Simulation is ran separately from the visual to allow for quick time passage.
